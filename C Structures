//Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. 
//Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
//Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).

struct MyStructure {   // Structure declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
};                     // End the structure with a semicolon

//Use the struct keyword inside the main() method, followed by the name of the structure and then the name of the structure variable:

struct myStructure {
  int myNum;
  char myLetter;
};

int main() {
  struct myStructure s1;
  return 0;
}

//Access Structure Members
//To access members of a structure, use the dot syntax (.):

// Create a structure called myStructure
struct myStructure {
  int myNum;
  char myLetter;
};

int main() {
  // Create a structure variable of myStructure called s1
  struct myStructure s1;

  // Assign values to members of s1
  s1.myNum = 13;
  s1.myLetter = 'B';

  // Print values
  printf("My number: %d\n", s1.myNum);
  printf("My letter: %c\n", s1.myLetter);

  return 0;
}
